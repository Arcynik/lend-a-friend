# Lend a Friend

Desktop and mobile tracking app for the things you borrow from friends and the things they borrow from you :)
This app has been developped in one day as a final exercice for my first IT degree.

It's based on: Spring, Spring-boot, Hibernate/JPA and thymeleaf.

To make it run: clone this repository, open a terminal, navigate to the project's folder and run:

```
mvn spring-boot run
```

Thanks for passing by :)
